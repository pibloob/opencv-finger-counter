# Finger Counter with Python and OpenCV

## Project Description

This project aims to create an efficient, open-source application using Python and OpenCV that detects a human hand through a webcam and counts the number of extended fingers in real-time. It's designed as a learning project for those interested in exploring the capabilities of computer vision with OpenCV in Python.

## Goals

1. Develop a real-time finger counting application.
2. Learn and implement basic to intermediate OpenCV functionalities.
3. Ensure the application is efficient and runs smoothly in real-time.
4. Create a resource that can be freely used and modified for educational purposes.

## Expected Functionalities

1. Real-Time Hand Detection: Detect a hand in real-time using a webcam.
2. Finger Counting: Count the number of extended fingers and display the count on the screen.
3. Efficiency: Optimize for a smooth real-time performance.

## Technologies Used

    Python: The primary programming language for the project.
    OpenCV: Used for image processing and computer vision tasks.
    NumPy: For handling numerical operations on images
